      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How often have you thought about trying new recipes, but never had the courage? Trying recipes from different cultures? 
          Or have you ever been stressed about what to make and eat? As college students filled to the brim with things to do, these kinds of concerns are common. 
          I want to gather a community of people to solve this problem. I will do this by creating a website specifically for the locals of Rexburg and Utah 
          with a well-organized navigation system for different types of recipes and how to most effectively find the ingredients in the respective region. 
          The design will be very simple and easy to navigate, but because of the simplicity, there is a possibility that the pages will be overloaded 
          with too many recipes. So, I will also create a review system where users with less time can immediately see the most-liked ones.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is mainly BYU-Idaho students. Students who enjoy cooking and learning new recipes from all over the world.
          They will be people who want to try new recipes, but don't know what to try nor where to get the proper ingredients in an efficient manner.
          Hopefully, locals of Rexburg can also find use for the website in finding different recipes to try especially those from other cultures since
          Rexburg has a diverse group of students from all over the world.

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The home page will have the standard navigation bar which will be present in all 3 pages. It will have a hero image just below the nav bar. Then, there will be a simple introduction to the website and how users can make the most of it. Then, there will be a showcase of an example recipe whether that be a random recipe or a trending recipe. Lastly, it will have a footer.
