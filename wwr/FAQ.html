                <li>Safety concerns</li>
                <p>We have an excellent safety record and can back this claim. Just call and ask our representatives!
                    We take great effort to ensure a safe and comfortable Whitewater Rafting experience. All of our guides have years of previous experiences and formal training.</p>
                <li>Cancellations</li>
                <p>We reserve the right to alter or cancel departure times due to river conditions, poor weather or insufficient number of reservations. A full refund will be made under these conditions. A 100% deposit is required with all reservations. 50% deposits will be accepted if needed. Full refunds are available only to those who cancel at least 48 hours prior to departure time. Groups of 10 or more and private trips must cancel 7 days prior to departure time to receive a full refund.</p>
                <li>What should I bring for the raft trip?</li>
                <p>Tamarack provides a raft, guide, transportation to and from the river, personal flotation devices and paddles.  You should wear shoes or sandals. Small backpacks with towels or dry clothes can be left in the shuttle and available for you when you get off the river.</p>
                <li>Do I need to tip the rafting guide?</li>
                <p>It is customary to tip your guides 10%, if they did a good job and you had a great time. Tips are appreciated.</p>
                <li>Requirements</li>
                <p>There are no requirements to Whitewater Raft with us except for an age requirement! We only take children as young as 5 that are supervised by adults.</p>
                <li>How many people can fit in one raft?</li>
                <p>There are no set number of people to fit in one raft. It varies on the type of raft and the accompanying size. For our family friendly trips, we can take rafts
                    that accomodate up to 9 paddlers including the guide. For more adventurous trips, we have rafts that accomodates 6 paddlers including the guide.
                    These are general guidelines and are flexible depending on safety considerations such as the water levels, total weight of the rafters, and the weather.</p>
                <li>Are there any discounts?</li>
                <p>Yes, we are currently offering a 10% discount to veterans, senior citizens, and students. They are subject to change, however.</p>
